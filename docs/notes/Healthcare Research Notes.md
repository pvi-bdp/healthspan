# Healthcare Research Notes

## Project Vision
Improve screening and diagnostic tools/assays for the purpose of early detection and application of personalized treatment protocols (preventive). The research relies on the concept that the nervous, endocrine and immune system interact to regulate homeostasis in the body.

## Project Goals
Develop mobile devices for the purpose of preventive testing that can be used with little training.

- OpenBCI equipment is battery powered, there is no pathway that mains current can flow into the subject (in the event of equipment failure.)
- enclosing the Cyton with a plastic box so that a live wire in its vicinity could not come into contact with its 8 differential, high gain, low noise input channels. https://openbci.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/2392/safety-housing-for-cyton-resolved
- The other area to compare this to, would be the field of neurofeedback. Where there are now many consumer devices being used as aids for meditation, relaxation, flow states, etc. Almost none of this consumer equipment has any medical certification.
