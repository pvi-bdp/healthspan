## Metabolic Regulation
The word vitamin is used to describe any of a heterogeneous group of organic molecules that are needed in small quantities for normal growth, reproduction, and homeostasis, but that the human body is unable to synthesize in adequate amounts. The group includes the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and the water-soluble vitamins (B-complex and C). Vitamins are generally needed in catalytic quantities and do not function as structural elements in the cell.
